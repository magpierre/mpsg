# MapRCLI_sg
A very simple statement generator for the maprcli interface
The MapRCLI interface has depth and can do amazing stuff but the sheer number of options makes it sometimes really hard to remember what options that are available.

This app is meant to assist in writing maprcli statements which you then can copy and run on a cluster near you.

So far only a few options has been done:

Acerole
Alarm
Audit
Dashboard
Entity
Streams
Table
Volume
